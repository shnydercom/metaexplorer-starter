# The 'packages' folder

In the packages folder you can put your own libraries. In this way you can easily separate libraries that rely heavily on metaexplorer (the 'mods' folder) from the ones that don't (the 'packages' folder). Or you build a metaexplorer-wrapper in the 'mods' folder for a general project sitting in the 'packages'-folder
